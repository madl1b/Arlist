# Arlist
Builds Spotify playlists based on user's artist of choice.

Guide:

Add your client ID and client secrets to Arlist.py

Set secret and config in app.py to something of your choice. 

The getPlaylist and artistPlaylist endpoints need an artist id. Here's how to get it: 
1) get the spotify url e.g. https://open.spotify.com/artist/2pAWfrd7WFF3XhVt9GooDL?si=tElHs4FBRpyJbEbTQ--tCw
2) get this part **2pAWfrd7WFF3XhVt9GooDL** bounded between / and ?
3) that's it 

What is danceability? 

Number [0,1] that indicates the energy and (wait for it) **danceability** of a track.
